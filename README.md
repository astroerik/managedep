This is a talk that I put together on how my organization manages Elevated Privileges in our environment. There are two versions of the talk. One with Demos (provided) and a slightly more updated (Short Talk) one without the Demos, due to being in a shorter talk slot. 

This talk was given at HCE 2015, NolaCon 2015, and BSides Indianapolis 2016. 

Scripts have been relatively sanitized and are hopefully documented well enough. 

While I'll be happy to answer questions, scripts are for reference only and I provide no support and offer no liability if they are implementd incorrectly.
